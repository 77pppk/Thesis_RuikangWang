            Same as before, but minAoI acquired by algorithm and exhaustive search in superposition scenario is different:

            *   Algorithm\_equal\_steps.m						// Obtain minAoI with proposed iterative search, for each variable, first run step1.m, save the data and run step2.m
            *   Search\_equal\_steps.m                         // Obtain minAoI with exhaustive search
